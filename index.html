            <h1>Reading</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p id="in">At the very beginning, I want to say that I literally admire my hobby, and one of my playschool teachers inspired me to fall in love with reading books when I was at my very early age. I still remember she used to bring me many kinds of colorful interesting books full of amazing stories as well as pictures.

                At that age, I fond of those kinds of books. Later on, I came to know that those books are known as comics. I have read so many comics since my early childhood. Tintin, Phantom, Dennis the Menace, Hada Bhoda, Nonte-Phonte is a few among them. My parents always appreciate my hobby of reading books. For me, reading any book is the way of my utmost relaxation.

                When I get tremendously bored of my regular monotonous life, at that point my storybooks help me to travel in some dream location being a part of some exciting adventure of imagination. After going to high school, I got exclusive access to my school’s students’ library and a different world opened there for me. From then, I borrow books so many kinds of books from my school library and read them thoroughly.

                Here, I would like to mention my school librarian sir Mr. Paresh Pathak who helpsme to choose the proper book according to my age and reading tendency. From my school library, I have read many works of great authors like Guru Rabindranath Tagore, Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, Satyajit Ray, and many more.

                Recently, I have developed a special interest in magic realism. Very recently, I was reading a work of the great Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The name of the book is very famous One Hundred Years of Solitude. It is an amazing work that led me to a different fantasy world along with the dark humorous touch of eternal truth.

                I’ve also read some works of Franz Kafka. His famous work The Metamorphosis will be very close to my heart always. For these also all credit goes my school librarian sir. He first suggested me to read something unconventional out of the box.

                I got the first book of Gabriel Garcia Marquez from him. Moreover, I learned about magic realism from him as well. I believe that no matter what happens with human beings, but books, stories, and realization are eternal. They will never abandon me in my entire life.

                <h1>Dancing</h1>


                <div class="line"></div>
                <p id="in">Dancing is my hobby. These days many people irrespective of their age do dancing. While dancing all you need are comfortable shoes and clothes. For instance, you cannot dance ballet wearing loose shoes.

                    Similarly all kinds of clothes do not match the dance style. For instance, dancing ballet wearing loose clothes will give you a strange look.The reason behind my dancing is my parents. They are a great source of inspiration for me. They dance with me so that I can dance and take my hobby forward. I never dance in the same style but I like to mix up everything. I know many types of dancing such as Jaz, tap, modern, hip hop, swing and western.

                    Each type of dance has its own way of moving and rhythm. One has to feel the rhythm and learn the style of dance. I dance because it is the best way to be healthy and keep myself fit. Dance makes me feel relax and happy.Dancing will always remain a part of my life. It is a kind of sports that every generation enjoys. On every special occasion I feel like dancing. When I dance in the parties nobody can stop me from moving my feet fast in the rhythm of the music. Even if someone does that it’s like applying efforts to stop a natural-disaster. Since childhood dancing is and has been my passion always. Dancing allows me to express my emotions. No matter where I am if music strikes my ears I feel like dancing.

                    Dancing involves technique, timing, eye and hand coordination, rhythm, emotion and personality. I am always keen to learn new steps of dancing and practice it whenever I get spare time out of my busy school schedule.

                    I hope someday I will become a successful professional dancer. But right now I have to focus on my studies as well so I am unable to dedicate enough time to my dancing hobby. I am doing stage shows in dancing for 1 ½ years and I am planning to continue this as far as it is possible for me.

                    I have my dancing group names Hi-Voltage. There are 8 (4 boys and 4 girls) members in my group. Our group competes in competitions and performs at community events and schools.

                    Among all the forms of dancing I find hip hop quiet interesting and funny. This is because to learn hip hop neither you do not have to be a really good dancer nor you have to buy special clothes to perform it. You can simply wear loose pants and a Tshirt and dance. Every individual has its own unique style in hip hop. One thing which is important is you have to enjoy your dance. I dance because it makes me confident and I enjoy dancing.

                <p id="in">My hobby is to code many apps, games and websites. I love to code. Sometimes, I have a mood to code stuff like an app which delivers information, a calculator which can know a lot about mathematics, a story with fun characters, an art where there is an interactive artist making many pictures, a game that features scores and points to collect, a binary art which is made of black and white ones and zeros, A chatbot which can interact a user with lots of information, a chatapp which can connect people across the world, a multiplayer game which everyone can play on their mobile, a simulation that carries information in a fun and interactive way, a website which can deliver information about the world with html, css and the most amazing part for making apps and games, Javascript. I have learned many concepts like loops, variables, events, sequences, algorithms, animations, behaviours, functions, UI/UX, GUI, HTML, CSS, JS(Javascript), arrays, simulations, etc. I have discovered elements like inputs, buttons, screens, labels, checkbox, text area, slider, etc. Also, I have coded on these websites like Code.org, Thunkable, Dialogflow, Firebase, Codepen.io, Brackets, etc. With so many coding types, forms, sites, elements and projects learnt.<br>
